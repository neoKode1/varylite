Build passes cleanly. Here's a summary of everything that was changed:

## Changes Made

### 1. `src/app.css` — Complete CSS overhaul
- **New color palette**: Shifted from neutral grays to a deeper slate-based palette (`#020617` base) for richer contrast
- **New accent colors**: Added cyan (`#22d3ee`), amber, and rose accent tones alongside the existing violet
- **New animations**: Added `slideDown`, `slideInLeft`, `spinSlow`, `scaleIn`, `bounceSoft`, `borderGlow`, `textGlow`, `orbFloat1`, `orbFloat2` keyframes with premium cubic-bezier easing curves
- **New utilities**: Added `glass-card` (gradient glass), `gradient-text-vivid`, `glow-border-cyan`, `gradient-border`, `mesh-gradient`, `hero-glow` for multi-layered visual effects
- **Improved scrollbar**: Gradient-styled scrollbar thumb

### 2. `src/routes/+page.svelte` — Main page restructured
- **Title made significantly larger**: Hero headline increased from `text-5xl/7xl/8xl` to `text-[4.5rem]/[7rem]/[9rem]/[10.5rem]` — roughly 30-40% bigger at every breakpoint, with a text-glow animation
- **Floating orb background**: Multiple animated gradient orbs with independent float animations instead of static blurs
- **Animated status badge**: Ping animation on the green dot indicator
- **Gradient CTA buttons**: Primary button uses purple gradient with shimmer overlay
- **Color-coded feature cards**: Each feature has its own color scheme (violet, cyan, emerald, rose, amber, blue) with hover glow effects and icon rotation
- **Section badges**: Each section now has a colored pill badge ("Capabilities", "How It Works", "Integrations")
- **How It Works**: Step numbers now use gradient backgrounds with connector lines between steps
- **Model showcase**: Provider names are color-coded by category with hover lift effects
- **Stats section**: Added icons per stat with hover scale animation
- **Enhanced spacing**: More generous padding between sections (py-28/py-36)

### 3. `src/lib/components/Nav.svelte` — Updated nav styling
- Active indicator uses gradient (`accent-500` to `cyan-400`)
- CTA button has gradient background with shimmer on hover
- Mobile menu uses `animate-slide-down` entrance

### 4. `src/lib/components/Footer.svelte` — Updated footer
- Added "All Systems Online" status badge with pulse animation
- Increased spacing and padding

### 5. `src/routes/+layout.svelte` & `src/app.html`
- Updated text color reference and theme-color meta tag to match new palette
